### Prerequisites
**Your project should be stored in a GitHub repository**
If you are new to GitHub or repositories, checkout the OSPO's [Beginner Guide to Creating GitHub Repos](https://dsacms.github.io/ospo-guide/resources/beginner-guide-github-repos/) before moving on to the next steps.

Does your repository align with the requirements of a Tier 2 project? To verify:

- Review the flowchart or use `tier-determiner.py` provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder?tab=readme-ov-file#need-help-picking-a-maturity-tier).
- Read more about [Tier 2](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/tree/main/tier2) and the overall [CMS OSPO maturity model framework](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/main/maturity-model-tiers.md).

#### Results

Here is the tier-2 repository link: https://github.com/DSACMS/medicare_monthly_enrollment_dashboard. Tier-2 was chose since this project is primarily inner-source development. 

### State the Benefits of Open Sourcing the Project

- [✔] **Cost Savings**

  By making the project freely available, this reduces licensing and acquisition costs.

- [✔] **Ease of Repurposing**

  The open nature of the code allows users to modify and adapt the software to suit their specific needs, fostering customization and flexibility.

- [✔] **Minimization of Vendor Lock-in/Flexibility of Vendor Choice**

  Users are not tied to a single vendor, providing the freedom to choose between different vendors.

- [✔] **Enable Transparency**

  The source code is accessible and visible to anyone, promoting transparency in how the software functions, which helps build trust.

- [ ] **Enable extension/extensibility**

  Users can extend and enhance the functionality of the software by adding their own features.

- [✔] **Increase Interoperability**

  Planning in the open enables future compatibility and interoperability between different systems and software applications.

- [ ] **Facilitate Experimentation/Early Adoption**

  Working in the open encourages experimentation and early adoption of cutting-edge technologies, leading to faster innovation and improvement in software capabilities.

### State the Risks of Open Sourcing the Project

- [ ] **Security Risks**

  Vulnerabilities may be exposed if the code is not thoroughly reviewed, potentially leading to security breaches or exploitation. (See: [SECURITY.md]({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/SECURITY.md)) Does this project connect to any CMS-internal only systems? Does this project require authorization or authentication to operate? Does this project detail any non-public directories of CMS/HHS systems or people?

- [ ] **Financial Risks**

  Costs may arise from maintaining code, community engagement, addressing security concerns, subscription costs, hardware costs, specialized tooling or infrastructure costs among others. Does this project require any ongoing financial costs or subscription fees? (e.g., Cloud Hosting, Specialized build systems, paid maintainers, paid libraries or dependencies.)

- [ ] **Privacy Risks**

  Does this project require access to non-public, non-synthetic PII, PHI, or other internal-only CMS systems containing such data or information?

### Questions

- Does the code contain or touch any private information such as Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI)?

  - What PII or PHI does this project contain?

- Does the code interface with any of CMS’ internal-only systems (e.g. mainframes, JIRA instances, databases, etc…)?

  - What processes do you go through internally to get access to the systems?

- Does the repository contain any keys or credentials to access or authenticate with CMS’ systems?

- Does this repository require any job codes to run?

If you answered “yes” to any of the above questions, your project may be ‘sensitive’ in nature and require a more thorough review before sharing publicly. Please reach out to [opensource@cms.hhs.gov](mailto:opensource@cms.hhs.gov) for guidance. If you answer yes to any of these questions above, it is best to NOT open source the product due to security reasons.

#### Results

* **No Sensitive Data**: It does not contain, process, or touch any PII or PHI; it works solely with public, aggregated enrollment statistics. 

* **Public Data Focus**: It operates entirely on open, high-level summary data fetched at runtime from the public data.cms.gov API.

* **No Secure Interfaces**: It does not connect to or interface with any internal-only CMS databases, mainframes, or intranet systems.

* **No Credentials**: It does not contain or require any API keys, tokens, secrets, or certificates.

* **No Special Permissions**: It does not require any internal job codes or administrative permissions to run.

* **Standard Environment**: It operates entirely as a static web site built with standard Node.js tooling (11ty) and client-side JavaScript.

### Code Review

The existing codebase should be given a one time, top-to-bottom code quality and security vulnerability review by two (or more) engineers who have written production code within the past two years, in the languages used in the project. Engineers should review credential management practices with the development team to ensure that any keys, passwords, or other sensitive configurations are not checked into source code or in the git history.

The engineers can be federal government employees or trusted partners from outside the agency from other contracts, or from independent testing contracts. Their names, organizations, comments and approval/disapproval on the overall codebase should be tracked in this document.

To provide independent review, the engineers should not have been involved in the development of the software product. This includes engineers who wrote part of the software or who directly provided technical direction and oversight in the creation of the software.

As part of the code review, engineers should reference modern listings of the most significant software security vulnerabilities. For instance, an acceptable description would be that the engineers showed how they used automated tools and manual review to check each item in [OWASP's current 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

#### Results

Approved by both: Kiran Sheik (Github: kmsheikh)  and Zion Muhammud (Github: zionmich)

### Code Analysis

At least one automated tool for code analysis (such as static code analysis tools) has been run on the codebase to look for security vulnerabilities, and results have been appropriately acted upon. Even if all findings are eventually fixed, if the initial scans revealed significant, severe vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection vulnerabilities), this indicates that the software development team may not be adhering to the best practices required for open source public release.

Automated tooling for code analysis should be incorporated as a regularly scheduled part of the application development process. The development team should briefly document how frequently they commit to running these automated scanning tools, and who will be running the tests, interpreting, and acting upon the results.

#### Toolkit

Below is a list of suggested tools to run for code analysis:

| Tool            | Description                                                                            | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

* **Contribution Policy:** All future pull requests and external contributions will be released under this same CC0 dedication.

### Review Commit History

Review the history of commits to the version control system used, and whether the team prefers to clean (e.g., rebase) this history before releasing to the public.

If not rebasing, verify that:

1. There are no obscene or impolite remarks in comments or commit history
2. There are no sensitive internal URLs/IP Addresses in comments or commit history
3. There are no credential files such as Passwords, API/SSH/GPG keys checked into the repo.

Consider using the following tools to perform the tasks above:

| Tool            | Description                                                                                             | Link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Results

Both the gitleaks and the bulk extractor came back clear meaning there is not any metadata or secrets present in the repository. 
* **Gitleaks** — Ran `gitleaks detect -v --config .github/workflows/.gitleaks.toml` against the full repository history.
  * **Result:** Scanned 118 commits (4.8 MB) using the repository's custom `.gitleaks.toml` rules. No leaks or secrets found.
* **bulk_extractor** — Ran `bulk_extractor -R . -o bulk-output` to recursively scan all directories for secrets, credentials, and embedded URLs/emails.
  * **Result:** No active secrets, credentials, or private internal URLs were identified.  
* **Appropriate content review** Our team manually reviewed and approved eachother's PRs for not only code quality but also appropriateness of commit messaging and everything was appropriate and relevant. 


### Review Repository Hygiene

As part of our repository hygiene requirements, the project must include certain files and sections. Using repolinter will help you identify missing files and content that will need to be added to your repository before outbounding.

#### Running repolinter on your repository locally

1. Add [repolinter.json](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/main/tier2/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/repolinter.json) to the root directory of your project

2. Run command:

```
repolinter lint

```

3. The result produces a list of file and section existence checks, indicating whether each requirement was met or not.

#### Running repolinter on your repository via GitHub Actions

1. Add the tier-specific [repoHygieneCheck.yml](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/main/tier2/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/.github/workflows/repoHygieneCheck.yml) to the github directory of your project. The file includes a job that runs repolinter called [repolinter-checks](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/main/tier2/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/.github/workflows/repoHygieneCheck.yml#L56)

2. Manually trigger the workflow.

3. The result produces an issue on the repository with a list of file and section
   existence checks, indicating whether each requirement was met or not.

#### Review Content

The project should include the following files and sections [(link to templates)]({{cookiecutter.project_slug}}):

- [✔] **LICENSE**

  _License of your project, whether public domain (CC0) or other OSI-approved License. Using
  ‘vanilla’ license text will allow for GitHub to auto-label the license information on the
  repository landing page._

- [✔] **code.json**

  _Contains metadata about the project, refer to [Review Project Metadata](#review-project-metadata)_

- [✔] **README.md**

  _An essential guide that gives viewers a detailed description of your project_

| Section                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Included? |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Project Description      | This should be 1-3 sentence short description of the project that can be used as a 'one-liner' to describe the repo. A best practice is using this same language as the official 'description' on a GitHub repo landing page.                                                                                                  | ✅        |
| About the Project        | This should be a longer-form description of the project.

#### Communications Style Guide

As you are writing content about the repository, consider the following when describing the project, the agency, and how work is done:

- **Focus on solutions, not problems**
  _Rather than describing the negatives and shortcomings of an existing project, process, or group, focus on highlighting the benefits, outcomes, and positive impacts of the solution. Be constructive and accentuate the positive._
- **Use Plain Language**
  _Be clear and concise when explaining concepts. Avoid jargon unless it is necessary and well-defined. Use active voice to be clearer and more engaging._
- **Focus on the audience**
  _Write for a broad audience, ensuring that developers, stakeholders, end-users, and viewers of all skill levels can understand and engage with the content._

Please refer to the style guides below for additional tips and guidance:

#### Results

An open source re-implementation of the CMS Medicare Monthly Enrollment dashboard, built as a static site with Eleventy and the U.S. Web Design System. The dashboard visualizes the Medicare Monthly Enrollment dataset published on data.cms.gov, which it queries directly from the browser through the public CMS Data API rather than through a bespoke backend. Users can explore national, state, and county level enrollment trends over time, compare Original Medicare against Medicare Advantage and Other Health Plan enrollment, drill from a national choropleth map into the counties of an individual state, and review the underlying figures in an accessible data grid. The project exists to show that the dashboard can be rebuilt with an open source stack and no proprietary dependencies, so that the code, the visualizations, and the accessibility work behind them can be reused by other teams and potentially deployed to data.cms.gov in the future.

### Review Project Metadata

As part of the [SHARE IT Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9566/text), [Federal Source Code Policy](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf), and the agency’s software inventory tracking initiatives, each repository must contain a [code.json file](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson/blob/main/docs/metadata.md), storing metadata on your project.

For more information on code.json, please review the [gov-codejson documentation repository](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson).

#### Creating code.json on your repository

**Using form site**

Users can fill out a web form that creates a code.json file to be uploaded to a project's source code repository: https://dsacms.github.io/codejson-generator.

**Using automated-codejson-generator**

The [automated-codejson-generator](https://github.com/DSACMS/automated-codejson-generator) is a GitHub Action that automatically generates and maintains code.json files for federal open source repositories. It ensures schema consistency and automates various metadata calculations.

**Using the repo-scaffolder cookiecutter CLI**

1. In the `.github` directory, run the command:

```
cookiecutter . –directory=codejson
```

2. Answer various questions about your project.

3. A code.json file will be generated with your responses.

As you continue development in this repository, it is important to keep this file up-to-date. Our [automated-codejson-generator](https://github.com/DSACMS/automated-codejson-generator) can assist with updating this file.

#### Results

A valid [`code.json`](/code.json) file has been successfully generated and committed to the root of the repository. The file accurately reflects the project's current metadata, contact information, and licensing, ensuring full compliance with the required federal open-source schema.

### Flipping the Switch: Making the Repository Public

Once the repository has passed outbound review, we are ready to “flip the switch” and officially make it public. Once made public, there are a couple of actions that need to be taken:

#### Repository Actions

Please enable the following features to enhance repository security and maintain code
quality:

- [✔] **Dependabot Alerts**

  _A GitHub Feature. Get notified when one of your dependencies has a vulnerability_

- [ ] **Secret Scanning Alerts**

  _A GitHub Feature. Get notified when a secret is pushed to this repository. Ideally set this up to run after each new commit is pushed to the Repository._

- [ ] **Branch Protections**

  _Ensures the integrity of important branches by preventing unauthorized actions like force pushes and requiring pull request reviews with specific checks before merging. Dev and main should be protected branches in the repository._

- [✔] **Git Branching**

  _After making the repository public, make sure there is a coherent git branching plan in place. For example: agree to merge feature related pull requests into dev but merge bug fixes into main instead of dev first._

- [✔] **Add Repolinter GH Action to CI**

  _For ongoing adherence to repository hygiene standards, integrate the [repolinter GitHub Action](https://github.com/DSACMS/metrics/blob/main/.github/workflows/checks.yml) into your CI pipeline. This addition enhances your workflow by automatically enforcing repository cleanliness standards._

- [ ] **Optional: DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)**

  _Requires all commit messages to contain the Signed-off-by line with an email address that matches the commit author. The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. The GitHub app to enforce DCO can be found [here](https://github.com/apps/dco) ._
